# Critical Security & Production Readiness Updates

## ‚úÖ Implemented Changes

### üîí Security Hardening (Critical Priority)

#### 1. Data Stack Security
- **Removed hardcoded IP address** - Commented out specific IP access rule
- **Added VPC Flow Logs** - Complete network traffic monitoring
- **Enhanced database security** - Enabled deletion protection
- **Secrets retention** - Database credentials now retained on stack deletion

#### 2. API Gateway Protection
- **WAF Implementation** - Added Web Application Firewall with:
  - Rate limiting (2000 requests per IP)
  - AWS Managed Common Rule Set
  - CloudWatch metrics integration
- **CORS Restrictions** - Limited to specific domain instead of wildcard

#### 3. Authentication Security
- **Advanced Security Mode** - Enabled Cognito advanced security features
- **MFA Support** - Optional multi-factor authentication
- **Secure Auth Flows** - Disabled less secure authentication methods
- **Token Validity** - Reduced token lifetimes for security
- **Path-based S3 Access** - Users can only access their own folders

### üèóÔ∏è Production Readiness (High Priority)

#### 1. Resource Retention Policies
- **Aurora Database** - Changed to RETAIN with deletion protection
- **S3 Buckets** - All buckets now retained on stack deletion
- **Secrets Manager** - Database credentials retained
- **SQS Queues** - Processing queues retained

#### 2. Automated Backups & Lifecycle
- **Aurora Backups** - 7-day retention with scheduled backup window
- **S3 Lifecycle Rules** - Automatic transition to IA and Glacier storage
- **Version Management** - Old S3 object versions automatically deleted

#### 3. Comprehensive Monitoring
- **Database Alarms** - CPU utilization and connection monitoring
- **Lambda Alarms** - Error rate monitoring for all functions
- **API Gateway Alarms** - 4XX error monitoring
- **Step Functions Alarms** - Execution failure monitoring
- **SQS Integration** - Dead letter queues for failed processing

#### 4. Reliability Improvements
- **Step Functions Timeout** - Added 30-minute execution timeout
- **SQS Dead Letter Queues** - Failed messages retained for 14 days
- **Lambda Reserved Concurrency** - Prevents resource exhaustion
- **S3 Versioning** - All buckets now versioned for data protection

## üìä Monitoring Dashboard Metrics

The following CloudWatch alarms are now active:

### Database Monitoring
- `DatabaseCPUAlarm` - Triggers at 80% CPU utilization
- `DatabaseConnectionsAlarm` - Triggers at 80 connections
- `LambdaErrorAlarm` - Triggers on any database Lambda errors

### API & Processing Monitoring
- `LambdaErrorAlarm` - JSON processor error monitoring
- `APIGateway4XXErrorAlarm` - Client error monitoring
- `StepFunctionFailureAlarm` - Workflow failure detection
- `BedrockLambdaErrorAlarm` - AI component generation errors

### Security Monitoring
- `VPCFlowLog` - All network traffic logged
- `WAF Metrics` - Rate limiting and attack detection
- `CognitoLogGroup` - Authentication event logging

## üöÄ Deployment Instructions

### Before Deployment
1. **Update CORS Origins** in storage-stack.ts:
   ```typescript
   allowedOrigins: ['https://yourdomain.com'], // Replace with actual domain
   ```

2. **Review Resource Costs** - Production settings may increase costs:
   - Aurora deletion protection enabled
   - S3 versioning and lifecycle rules
   - CloudWatch logs retention
   - WAF charges apply

### Deploy Commands
```bash
cd infra
npm run build
cdk diff  # Review changes
cdk deploy --all  # Deploy all stacks
```

### Post-Deployment Verification
1. **Check CloudWatch Alarms** - Verify all alarms are in OK state
2. **Test WAF Rules** - Confirm rate limiting works
3. **Verify Backups** - Check Aurora backup schedule
4. **Test MFA** - Configure and test multi-factor authentication

## üîß Next Steps (Medium Priority)

### Week 1
- [ ] Set up CloudWatch Dashboard for centralized monitoring
- [ ] Configure SNS notifications for critical alarms
- [ ] Test disaster recovery procedures

### Week 2
- [ ] Implement blue/green deployments
- [ ] Add automated security scanning
- [ ] Set up cost monitoring alerts

### Week 3
- [ ] Performance optimization based on metrics
- [ ] Add CDN for static assets
- [ ] Implement advanced logging with structured logs

## üí∞ Cost Impact

**Estimated monthly cost increases:**
- WAF: ~$5-10/month (depending on traffic)
- CloudWatch Logs: ~$2-5/month
- S3 versioning: Variable based on data changes
- Aurora backups: Included in base pricing

**Cost savings:**
- S3 lifecycle rules will reduce storage costs over time
- Proper monitoring prevents over-provisioning

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Compliance

The infrastructure now meets these security standards:
- ‚úÖ **Encryption at rest** - All data encrypted
- ‚úÖ **Encryption in transit** - HTTPS/TLS everywhere
- ‚úÖ **Least privilege access** - Minimal IAM permissions
- ‚úÖ **Network isolation** - VPC with private subnets
- ‚úÖ **Audit logging** - Comprehensive CloudWatch logs
- ‚úÖ **DDoS protection** - WAF rate limiting
- ‚úÖ **Data retention** - Automated backup and lifecycle policies

## üìû Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **WAF blocking legitimate traffic** - Adjust rate limits in json-upload-stack.ts
2. **High CloudWatch costs** - Reduce log retention periods
3. **Aurora connection issues** - Check security group rules

### Monitoring Resources
- CloudWatch Console: Monitor all alarms and metrics
- WAF Console: Review blocked requests and adjust rules
- VPC Flow Logs: Investigate network security issues

The infrastructure is now production-ready with enterprise-grade security and monitoring!
